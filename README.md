# Hackathons

Solutions to Past Hackathons, solved by members of QC @ IITI

## Adding a Solution

To add a solution, fork the repository and add your code. Once your changes are done, create a pull-request targeting the `main` branch. 

Your submission must include code and a brief explanation in a `README.md` file. For example, if you solved Games 200 from Xanadu QHack 2022, you can create a pull request that adds `QHack2022/Games200/README.md` and `QHack2022/Games200/solution.py`. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Do not include jupyter notebooks. If the hackathon requires you to work with notebooks, solve the questions first, validate them, then copy-and-paste the code into your fork.

> [!TIP]
> Check the repository for folders before creating your PRs to help avoid clutter.
